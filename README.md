# CardMatchingFight

## Downloading
Simply clone my GitHub repository and you have all the code ready to go. No extra requirements to install.

`$ git clone https://github.com/zachstence/CardMatchingFight`

## Running the Game
First compile the main class

`$ g++ main.cpp`

Then, run the program and provide a seed to use for random number generation 
(to ensure a predictable outcome)

`$ ./a.out 1234`

If no seed is provided, the program will use a random device to ensure a random outcome.

The program will print information about the game to the screen, as well as save information in a 
log file named "`log.txt`".

## Report
I have written a [short report](report.pdf) detailing my design and implementation of the game.
